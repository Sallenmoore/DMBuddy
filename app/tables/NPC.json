More than once, he and his father had to abandon the wagon to bandits. What little free time Andrei had would be spent fishing at the nearby Rue River. \n\nAt 15, while exploring a wooded area, Andrei stumbled on one of the Stone Gates, guarded by several Sentrys. Never able to resist something mysterious, snuck through the brush to get a closer look. He could feel the buzzing of the stone as he reached out from his hiding spot to touch the carved runes lining the edges.\n\nScenes of great destruction began flashing through his mind. As the vision continued, he was flying over farmland and forests, careening through white clouds. He passed golden fields of wheat and green pastures of grazing animals. When he glanced back,the world had all vanished into black, as though he was erasing the existence itself wherever he went.\n\nA sentry noticed him and shoved himaway from the gate, breaking his contact with it. He opened his eyes, shaking in terror, not at the Sentry with his sword drawn in his face, at the something he felt watching at him through the Gate. While the Sentry's warned him to stay away, Andrei gathered himself, then made his way back to his family's farm. \n\nAlthough he felt he had only been gone for several hours, his family explained that he had been missing for days. When he tried to explain what he saw in his vision, he was dismissed as the fantasies of a young boy. Andrei became obsessed with Gates, learning anything he could. He would sneak off to local temples and booksellers, investigating every hint of the Gates he could find. Eventually, Andrei discovered the existence of the *Order of Sea and Stone* and the role of the Gates in Coia's past.\n\nWhen he abandoned the family farm to join the Order, his parents did not understand. \"We'll starve without your help working the farm,\" they insisted; however, Andrei believed that nothing was more important than the Gates, not even his family. When he left, he knew how unlikely it was he would ever see his family again.\n\nAfter joining the order, his determiniation and aptitude quickly gained the notice of the highest ranking members of the order.
