His thin gray hair is kept in a neat bun, and a well-groomed beard covers a good portion of his face. He wears worn but carefully maintained robes of muted colors, and leans heavily on an intricate walking cane.", "backstory": "Orrin spent most of his life as a librarian in a quiet mountain town, seemingly content to live out his days in peace, surrounded by books. However, this life of simplicity was a carefully constructed facade; Orrin secretly harbored a rare gift. He was a 'Voidminder', one of the few beings capable of manipulating void energies usually inaccessible to humans. Shy and distrustful, Orrin has been dishonest about his gift, hiding his true potential under the guise of a simple librarian.", "personality": ["Dishonest", "Shy", "Intuitive"], "occupation": "Librarian", "race": "Human", "speed": {}, "class_name": "Wizard", "age": 80, "hp": 0, "wealth": [], "inventory": ["A walking cane", "Numerous books on arcane theories", "A pendant containing void energy", "A pouch filled with various herbs", "Old library key"], "str": 9, "dex": 11, "con": 13, "wis": 16, "int": 18, "cha": 14, "features": {}, "spells": {}, "resistances": []}}}
