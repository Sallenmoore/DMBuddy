More than once, he and his father had to abandon the wagon to bandits. What little free time Andrei had would be spent fishing at the nearby Rue River. \n\nAt 15, while exploring a wooded area, Andrei stumbled on one of the Stone Gates, guarded by several Sentrys. Never able to resist something mysterious, snuck through the brush to get a closer look. He could feel the buzzing of the stone as he reached out from his hiding spot to touch the carved runes lining the edges.\n\nScenes of great destruction began flashing through his mind. As the vision continued, he was flying over farmland and forests, careening through white clouds. He passed golden fields of wheat and green pastures of grazing animals. When he glanced back,the world had all vanished into black, as though he was erasing the existence itself wherever he went.\n\nA sentry noticed him and shoved himaway from the gate, breaking his contact with it. He opened his eyes, shaking in terror, not at the Sentry with his sword drawn in his face, at the something he felt watching at him through the Gate. While the Sentry's warned him to stay away, Andrei gathered himself, then made his way back to his family's farm. \n\nAlthough he felt he had only been gone for several hours, his family explained that he had been missing for days. When he tried to explain what he saw in his vision, he was dismissed as the fantasies of a young boy. Andrei became obsessed with Gates, learning anything he could. He would sneak off to local temples and booksellers, investigating every hint of the Gates he could find. Eventually, Andrei discovered the existence of the *Order of Sea and Stone* and the role of the Gates in Coia's past.\n\nWhen he abandoned the family farm to join the Order, his parents did not understand. \"We'll starve without your help working the farm,\" they insisted; however, Andrei believed that nothing was more important than the Gates, not even his family. When he left, he knew how unlikely it was he would ever see his family again.\n\nAfter joining the order, his determiniation and aptitude quickly gained the notice of the highest ranking members of the order. At 40, he became the youngest person to ever gain the position of High Cleric, a lifetime appointment.\n\nHis continued blind devotion to preserving the stone portals at all cost, and fear of losing his position stand in direct opposition to his actions working behind the scenes to help the Unchained.", "personality": [], "occupation": "", "race": "", "speed": {}, "class_name": "Cleric", "age": 0, "hp": 0, "wealth": " ", "inventory": [" "], "str": null, "dex": null, "con": null, "wis": null, "int": null, "cha": null, "features": {}, "spells": [], "resistances": "", "canon": true, "wa_article_id": null, "wikijs_id": 844, "level": 2, "connections": {"4": {"name": "Sister Loretta Maize", "relationship": "neutral"}, "5": {"name": "Lucius Blackthorne", "relationship": "enemy"}, "6": {"name": "Brother Aldric", "relationship": "neutral"}, "7": {"name": "Andrei Malring", "relationship": "friend"}, "8": {"name": "Ellurei", "relationship": "friend"}, "9": {"name": "Eldathra", "relationship": "aquaintance"}, "10": {"name": "Nemrissa", "relationship": "strangers"}, "11": {"name": "Elara Vaneir", "relationship": "neutral"}}, "last_updated": {"_datetime": "2023-08-23T05:45:33.882273"}}, "8": {"pk": 8, "npc": true, "name": "Ellurei", "gender": "Non-binary", "image": {"asset_id": "d1917240835fe080ec0f7a45b1bc99ea", "url": "http://res.cloudinary.com/dzzdfujbf/image/upload/v1692389370/dnd/npcs/tm2vv6lnohacud7nivtd.png", "raw": null}, "ac": 21, "desc": "Elven with silver hair.\nGreen eyes that exude menace.\nHas a quick and nervous edge to movements", "backstory": "Ellurei was raised among the high elves, educated in the sacred libraries, yet was always an outsider due to their rebellious tendencies.

His true loyalty was to his homeland which he was forced to leave years ago. His acts of perceived disloyalty were in fact, attempts to protect his true king. Even his disloyal acts were a testament of his ultimate loyalty. His greatest secret? He was planning a coup to overthrow the king he publicly served.",

Alastair responds with a laugh, acknowledging the claim and explaining that trust is a complex concept, often influenced by the holder's will. He admits to being bound by duties and loyalty, even showing a scar on his face as proof of his service to a king. However, he also mentions that his loyalty sometimes requires him to protect one thing at the expense of another, which can lead to perceptions of untrustworthiness. Alastair then redirects the conversation back to the player, expressing curiosity about their motivations for being there.",

His muscular frame radiates a readiness, a sense of anticipating a fight. He touches the scar on his face, suggestive of battles fought long ago and the commitment to survive. \"Your courage, I commend, stranger. It's not every day someone dares to confront me about my... questionable loyalties.\u201d\n\nHe steps closer, the sound of chain mail softly clinking echoing in the silence.  His voice, once booming, now settles into a quiet, deadly whisper, \"Isn't it fascinating how each of us are bound by our duties? Your duty to end my life, and mine to protect my kings. But you're mistaken if you think I've been hiding in the fears of my secrets.\"\n\nHe purses his lips, a thoughtful expression on his face, and glances at the sword on your hip. \"But before we dance with death, might I inquire who sent you? And do you always followed orders without question? It seems to me we might have more in common than you think...\" He lifts the tankard to his lips, the gently amused look twining with a spark of curiousity as he awaits your answer."
